In theory, a Logistic regression takes input and returns an output of probability, a value between 0 and 1. How does a Logistic Regression do that? With the help of a function called a logistic function or most commonly known as a **sigmoid**. This sigmoid function is reponsible for predicting or classifying a given input.\n",

    "Despite all of these, our function performed quite well I would say, (LOL) it's not that far out from the accuracy of sklearn, however there are other metrics to consider in comparing these models as well.\n",

    "To wrap things up let us review our objectives and wether we've accomplished them. The first objective was to understand the dataset itself and our EDA helped us gain better insights of the same. Secondly, we wanted to understand the theory behind Logistic Regression. The third objective was to implement the Logistic Regression without using built-in Logistic Regression libraries, yes we've done that as well, and it was trained, and evaluated. \n",

    "> This logistic regression implementation would probably be never used in production and it is unlikely that it will defeat sklearn's own LogisticRegression module, however the goal of this kernel was to understand intrecately the structure of different algorithms, in this case, Logistic Regression. \n",
